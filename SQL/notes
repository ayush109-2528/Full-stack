database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of a database management system DBMS
Type pf databases :
1 noSQl:
    Document-based, key-value, column-family, or graph-based
    Flexible schema
    Horizontally scalable
    Better for large-scale data and fast read/write operations

2 SQl(Relational databases)
    Tables with rows and columns
    Fixed schema (predefined structure)
    Vertically scalable
    Efficient for complex queries and transactions

create table:
        create table product {
        id int NOT NULL,
        name String,
        price Money,
        primary key (id)
    }

Insert data:
    Insert into product values(1,"pen", 1.20)
    Insert into product values(1,"pen")

read :
    select * from  product

select:
    select "column"  from table where (condition) column >= column 2

UPDATE: UPDATE command is a Data Manipulation Language command that performs on the data level and is used to update the details of a table. ------
    update table(product)
    SET price =0.4
    where price = 0.8

ALTER : Data Definition Language command that operates on the structure level and is used to add, remove, and change the details of the tables in a database.------------

    alter TABLE "tablename"(product)
    add stock INt
    after this we add values using update method
    update product
    set stock = 50
    where id = 1;

Delete :
    Delete from table name
    where id = 2 

Relationships in SQl
    create table custumer (custumerid int ,
    id int ,  quantity
    , primary KEy(id)
    foreign key(custumerid) references product(id) )

joins:
    select orders.orderid , custumer.firstname,  custumer.lastName
    from orders
    inner join custumerid on  orders.orderid = custumerid
