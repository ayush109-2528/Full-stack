# Web Authentication Project

This project is part of my Full Stack Web Development learning journey. It focuses on implementing secure user authentication using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **PostgreSQL**, along with **Google OAuth** integration.

## 🔐 Features

- User registration with email and password
- Password encryption and hashing using `bcrypt`
- User login and logout functionality
- Session management with `express-session` and cookies
- Google OAuth 2.0: Sign in with Google
- Flash messages for user feedback

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, EJS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (using pgAdmin and `pg` library)
- **Authentication**: Passport.js (Local + Google OAuth strategies)
- **Other Tools**: dotenv, express-session, bcrypt, connect-pg-simple

## 🚀 Getting Started
